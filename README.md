# Traffic-Light-Controller-Using-Verilog

# Introduction
The Traffic Light Controller project demonstrates the design and implementation of a traffic signal management system using Verilog HDL. This system is crucial for controlling traffic lights at intersections, ensuring safe and efficient traffic flow. The controller uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage the timing and sequencing of traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green) for different traffic directions. This project is suitable for FPGA implementations and digital system design practice.
